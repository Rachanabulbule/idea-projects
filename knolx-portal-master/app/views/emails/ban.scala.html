<p>Hi,</p>

<p>
    You're banned from attending and presenting Knolx sessions for <strong>1 month</strong> as you did not submit
    feedback for the following session(s):
</p>
<ul>
    @for(info <- emailsInfo) {
        <li>@info.topic by @info.presenter held on @info.date</li>
    }
</ul>

<p>
    Getting banned more than 3 times would result in a permanent ban.
    <br>
    If you think this is an error please contact Knolx Admin Team.
</p>

<p>
    Thanks,
    <br>
    Admin
</p>
